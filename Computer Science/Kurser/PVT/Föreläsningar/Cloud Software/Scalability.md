- Scalability automatically increases capacity depending on the load. - [[Elasticity]] decreases capacity as well
- **scaling-out** = adding new [[Virtual Machine|virtual server]]
- **scaling-up** = increase the power of a system server
- scaling-out is cheaper and easier on the cloud, but your individual software components have to be able to be replicated and run in parallell. This is done by a monitoring service, that can add or remove servers as needed.
