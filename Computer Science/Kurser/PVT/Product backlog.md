The product backlog is a list of what needs to be done to complete the devel-
opment of the product. The items on this list are called product backlog items
(PBIs). The product backlog may include a variety of different items such
as product features to be implemented, user requests, essential development
activities, and desirable engineering improvements. The product backlog
should always be prioritized so that the items that will be implemented first
are at the top of the list ([[Ian Sommerville, 2021]], s. 42).

Items in the backlog can have three different states:
- [[Ready for consideration]]
- [[Ready for refinement]]
- [[Ready for implementation]]
