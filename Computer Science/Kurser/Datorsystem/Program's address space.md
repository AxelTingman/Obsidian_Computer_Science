Address space -> the set of accessible  
addresses + state associated with them:  
– For a 32-bit processor there are 232 = 4 billion  
addresses  

What happens when you read or write to  
an address?  
– Perhaps Nothing  
– Perhaps acts like regular memory  
– Perhaps ignores writes  
– Perhaps causes I/O operation  
• (Memory-mapped I/O)  
– Perhaps causes exception (fault)
