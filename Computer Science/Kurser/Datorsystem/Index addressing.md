Indexed addressing uses a register (implicitly or  
explicitly) as an offset, which is added to the  
address in the operand to determine the effective  
address of the data.

#### Difference from [[Based addressing]]:
An index register holds an offset relative to the address given  
in the instruction, a base register holds a base  
address where the address field represents a  
displacement from this base.
