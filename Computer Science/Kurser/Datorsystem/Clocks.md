Every computer contains at least one clock that syncronizes the activites of it's components

A fixed number of clock cycles are required to carry out each data movement or computational operation.

The clock fequency, measured in megahertz or gigaherz, determines the speed with all operations are carried out.

Clock cycle time is the reciprocal of clock frequency.

CPU-clockan b√∂r inte blandas ihop med [[CPU-tid|CPU-tiden]], dvs. tiden det tar att exekvera ett program.
