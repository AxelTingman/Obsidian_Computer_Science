# Associative cache
***
• Associative cache combines the ideas of direct  
mapped cache and fully associative cache.  
• An N-way set associative cache mapping is like  
direct mapped cache in that a memory reference  
maps to a particular location in cache.  
• Memory reference maps to a set of several cache  
blocks,  
• Instead of mapping anywhere in the entire cache, a  
memory reference can map only to the subset of  
cache slots.
