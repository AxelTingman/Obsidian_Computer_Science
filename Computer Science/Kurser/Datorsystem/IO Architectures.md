• Input/output as a subsystem of components  
– Moves coded data between external devices and a  
host system.  
• I/O subsystems include:  
– Blocks of main memory that are devoted to I/O functions.  
– Buses that move data into and out of the system.  
– Control modules in the host and in peripheral devices  
– Interfaces to external components such as keyboards and  
disks.  
– Cabling or communications links between the host system  
and its peripherals.
