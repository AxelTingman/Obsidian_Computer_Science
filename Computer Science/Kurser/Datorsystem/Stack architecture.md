• Stack architectures require us to think about  
arithmetic expressions a little differently.  
• We are accustomed to writing expressions using  
infix notation, such as: Z = X + Y.  
• Stack arithmetic requires that we use postfix  
notation: Z = XY+.  
– This is also called reverse Polish notation, (some  
what) in honor of its Polish inventor, Jan  
Lukasiewicz (1878 - 1956).
