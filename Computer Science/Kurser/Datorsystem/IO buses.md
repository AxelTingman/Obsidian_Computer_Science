# IO buses
***

• I/O buses, unlike memory buses, operate  
asynchronously. Requests for bus access must  
be arbitrated among the devices involved.  
• Bus control lines activate the devices when they  
are needed, raise signals when errors have  
occurred, and reset devices when necessary.  
• The number of data lines is the width of the bus.  
• A bus clock coordinates activities and provides  
bit cell boundaries.
