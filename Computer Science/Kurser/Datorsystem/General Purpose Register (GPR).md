• Most systems today are GPR systems.  
• There are three types:  
– [[Memory-memory]] where two or three operands  
may be in memory.  
– [[Register-memory]] where at least one operand must  
be in a register.  
– [[Load-store]] where no operands may be in memory.  
• The number of operands and the number of  
available registers has a direct affect on  
instruction length.
