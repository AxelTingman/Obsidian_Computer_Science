 # Data Transmission Modes  
 ***
 
• Bytes can be conveyed from one point to another  
by sending their encoding signals simultaneously  
using parallel data transmission or by sending  
them one bit at a time in serial data transmission.

• In parallel data transmission, the interface requires  
one conductor for each bit.  
• Parallel cables are fatter than serial cables.  
• Compared with parallel data interfaces, serial  
communications interfaces:  
– Require fewer conductors.  
– Are less susceptible to attenuation.  
– Can transmit data farther and faster.
