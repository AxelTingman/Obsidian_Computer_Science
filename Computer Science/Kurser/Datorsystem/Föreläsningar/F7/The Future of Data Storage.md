• Future exponential gains in data storage most  
likely will occur through the use of totally new  
technologies.  
• Research into finding suitable replacements for  
magnetic disks is taking place on several fronts.  
• Some of the more interesting technologies include:  
– Biological materials  
– Holographic systems and  
– Micro-electro-mechanical devices.

• Present day biological data storage systems  
combine organic compounds such as proteins or oils  
with inorganic (magentizable) substances.  
• Early prototypes have encouraged the expectation  
that densities of 1Tb/in 2 are attainable.  
• Of course, the ultimate biological data storage  
medium is DNA.  
– Trillions of messages can be stored in a tiny strand of  
DNA.  
• Practical DNA-based data storage is most likely  
decades away.

#### Holographic storage 
• Holographic storage uses a pair of laser beams to etch a  
three-dimensional hologram onto a polymer medium.

• Data is retrieved by passing the reference beam through  
the hologram, thereby reproducing the original coded  
object beam.

39  
• Because holograms are three-dimensional,  
tremendous data densities are possible.  
• Experimental systems have achieved over 30Gb/in 2 ,  
with transfer rates of around 1GBps.  
• In addition, holographic storage is content  
addressable.  
– This means that there is no need for a file directory on  
the disk. Accordingly, access time is reduced.  
• The major challenge is in finding an inexpensive,  
stable, rewriteable holographic medium.
