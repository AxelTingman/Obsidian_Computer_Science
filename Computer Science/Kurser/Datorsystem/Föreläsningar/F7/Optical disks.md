• Optical disks provide large storage capacities very  
inexpensively.  
• They come in a number of varieties including CD-  
ROM, DVD, and WORM.

document output on optical disk rather than on  
paper. This idea is called COLD-- Computer Output  
Laser Disk.  
• It is estimated that optical disks can endure for a  
hundred years. Other media are good for only a  
decade-- at best.
