• RAID, an acronym for Redundant Array of  
Independent Disks was invented to address  
problems of disk reliability, cost, and performance.  
• In RAID, data is [[Data storage|stored]] across many disks, with  
extra disks added to the array to provide error  
correction (redundancy).  
• The inventors of RAID, David Patterson, Garth  
Gibson, and Randy Katz, provided a RAID  
taxonomy that has persisted for a quarter of a  
century, despite many efforts to redefine it.

## Different levels:
- [[RAID Level 0]]
- [[RAID Level 1]]
- [[RAID Level 2]]
- [[RAID Level 3]]
- [[RAID Level 4]]
- [[RAID Level 5]]
- [[RAID Level 6]]
- [[RAID DP]]
