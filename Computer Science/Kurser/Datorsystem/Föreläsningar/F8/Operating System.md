- A special layer of software that provides application software to hardware resources.
-  Convenient abstraction of complex hardware devices
-  Protected access to shared resources
-  [[OS Security and Protection|Security and authentication]]
-  Communication amongst logical entities


## OS tool: [[Virtual Machine]]

Software Engineering Problem:  
– Turn hardware/software quirks Þ what programmers want/need  
– Optimize for convenience, utilization, security, reliability, etc...  

For Any OS area (e.g. file systems, virtual memory,  
networking, scheduling):  
– What’s the hardware interface? (physical reality)  
– What’s the application interface? (nicer abstraction)

## Main Roles:  
 - Allow user applications to run on a given machine’s hardware  
 - Act as a “traffic cop” for allocating resources.  

## Resources  
- [[CPU]], [[IO|I/O devices]], [[Types of memory|Memory]], Files, Allocation  

## Processes  
– versus Programs  
– [[Scheduling ; Schemaläggning|Scheduling]]  
– Synchronization  
- Memory Management  
- File Management

## OS concepts
- [[Thread Control]]

- [[Program's address space]]
