• How does this relate to Object Oriented Programming?  
• An important difference:  
– Class definition vs.  
– Object creation / instantiation  
• Class definitions are created at compile time.  
• Objects don’t really get created until the program is  
running as a process.  
– The “new” command in java tells the operating system to allocate  
some memory and put the new object in that space.  
• When the process ends,  
– the class definitions do not disappear, but  
– the objects disappear.  
meaning that the memory allocated to the objects gets reallocated for  
some other purpose.
