• In very large computers, subsystems do not go far  
enough to establish a protected environment.  
• Logical partitions (LPARs) provide much higher  
barriers: Processes running within a logical partition  
have no access to processes running in another  
partition unless a connection between them (e.g.,  
FTP) is explicitly established.  
• LPARs are an enabling technology for the recent  
trend of consolidating hundreds of small servers  
within the confines of a single large system.
