## RFID data stream processing
● RFID data cleaning (uncertainty and unreliability) 
	– The false reads in RFID streams can be classified into two categories: 
		• Missing-reads 
		• Cross-reads 
● RFID data inference and compression 
	– Techniques will need to clean RFID data first and then infer to the high level information about the tagged objects, i.e., location and containment relationships. 
● RDF triple stream processing 
	– Linked Data is a method for publishing structured data and interlink such data to make it more useful 
	– Data from different sources can be connected and queried in the form of Linked Data – Stream reasoning can provide the abstractions, foundations, methods and tools required to integrate data streams 
	– Substantial research efforts have been put forward, focusing on how to apply reasoning on streaming data, how to publish raw streaming data and connect them to the existing data sets on the Semantic Web, and how to extend the SPARQL query language to process streaming data. 
● Linked stream processing and reasoning 
	– Efforts to apply the linked data principles to stream (sensor) data have been initiated and this wealth of information could be easily included in the Linked Data cloud. 
	– Continuous SPARQL 
● Extracting RDF triples from unstructured data streams 
	– Although the current Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has tremendously grown over the last few years, it delivers mostly encyclopedic information (such 11/25/2021 as albums, places, and kings) and fails to provide up-to-date information.
