## Stream mining
● Clustering 
	– Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group. 
	– typically continuously cluster objects on memory constrained devices 
	– Requirements to consider when designing algorithms for clustering data streams : 
		1. providing clustering results via fast and incremental processing of data objects. 
		2. rapidly detecting new clusters or changes of existing clusters. 
		3. scaling to the potentially unbounded number of objects in data streams. 
		4. providing a model representation that is consistently compact regardless of the number of data objects. 
		5. rapidly detecting the presence of outliers and acting accordingly; and 6. dealing with different data types, such as XML trees, DNA sequences, GPS temporal and spatial information. 
● Classification: 
	– Uses prior knowledge to guide the partitioning process to construct a set of classifiers to represent the possible distribution of patterns. Classification is a supervised learning process whereas clustering is an unsupervised learning process 
● Outlier and anomaly detection 
	– Main task is to find data points that are most different from the remaining points in a given data set. 
● Frequent item set mining 
	– To find sets of items or values that co-occur frequently, or in other words, to find co- occurrence relationships in a transactional data set.
