## Query Processing
● Aggregate Queries 
	– Import class of queries in sensor system ( MIN, COUNT and AVG operators) – Techniques have been proposed to efficiently [[Kurser/Internet of Things/Föreläsningar/F1/Process|process]] these aggregate operators in sensor systems to effectively reduce power consumption. 
	– the properties of the aggregate functions in-network partial data could be preprocessed first, then be utilized to produce the final results for the issued queries. 
● Join queries 
	– To evaluate the query, stream readings from the sensors in regions R1 and R2 should be joined first before determine an object was detected in the two designated regions. Return the objects that were detected in both regions R1 and R2. 
● Top-k Monitoring 
	– most recently communicated top-k answers by maintaining some specified arithmetic constraints at the stream sources. 
	– User specified error tolerance is also considered in order to provide high-quality answers. This technique can help reduce the overall communication cost between different sources. 
● Continuous queries: To monitor designated changes in an environment, sensors are typically required to answer queries in continuous manner
