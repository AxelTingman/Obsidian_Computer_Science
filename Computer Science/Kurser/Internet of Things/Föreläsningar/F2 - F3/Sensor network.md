- Most essential coposnent of the [[IoT architecture|IoT]] is the Sensor network, both wired and wireless.
- Sensors can be momogenous or heterogenous
- Multiple sensor networks with different communicaiton technologies and multiple protocols

## Three main architectures
- **Flat**: Data transfer from static sensor nodes to the sink node using a multi-hop fashin
- **Two layer**: Static and mobile sink nodes are deployed to collect data from sensor nodes.
- **Three layer**: Multiple sensor networks are connected together over the internet. IoT follows this kind of architecture.

## Several major wireless sensor networks

## Sensor networks use protocol for communicaiton
- Non IP based
- IP based protocol

## Categories of sensor networks that comprise the IoT
- Body sensor networks (BSN)
- Object sensor networks (OSN)
- Environment sensor networks (ESN)

## Challenges need to be considered when developing wireless sensor
- Abstract support.
- Data fusion
- Resource constraints
- Dynamic topology
- Programming paradigm
- Asaptability
- Acalability
- Security
- QoS support

## Layers
- Low end sensor node
- High end sensor node
- Sink nodes, static or mobile
- Mobile, low end computational devices
- High-end computational devices
- Cloud

## Relationship between Sensor netwoeks and IoT
- Sensor networks comprises of the sensor hardware, firmware, (...)
