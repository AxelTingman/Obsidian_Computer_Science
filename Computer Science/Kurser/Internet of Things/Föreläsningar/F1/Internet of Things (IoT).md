- Ambient intelligence: Auto-organize themselves depending on tje context, circumstances or environment
- Flexible structure: Hundred of thousands of nodes will be disable and will be set to run
- Semantic sharing: Machine can rend and sen by themselves. No need to tell human beings.
- Complex access Technologies: several kinds of media such a vehicle stone that they need different access technologies
- Event driven: Design the scheme depending on the need. 

## Context
- Anytime, any context
- anyone, anybody
- any service, any business
- any path any network
- any place, anywhere
- any device

## Why IoT?
- Dynamic control of industry and daily life
- Improve the rescource utilization ratio
- Integrating human society and physical systems.
- Flexible configuration
- Universal transport and internetworking
- Acts as technologies integrator

## Characteristics
- Intelligense
	- Application of knowledge
	- Knowledge by generating data and reasoning it
	- Context can be used to fuse sensor data
- Architecturr
	- a hybrid architecture which comprises many different architectures
	- Two architectures:
		- Event driven: sensors produce data when an event occurs
		- Time driven: sensor produces data continuosly based on specific time frames.
- Complex system
	- IoT comprises a large number of objects that interact autonomously
	- Some new objects existing ones
	- Some objects have few capabilities such as storing very limited information. Some objects are even able to process and reason data.
- Size considerations
	- 50 billion devices connected by the internet by 2023
	- IoT needs to facilitate the interaction among these objects
- Time considerations
- Space considerations
- Everything as a service
	- Cloud computing, consuming resources as a service
	- Highly efficient, scalable and easy to use
	- IoT demands significant amounts of infrastructure to be put in one place in order to make it's vision a reality
		- Crowd based approach
		- Sensing-as-a-service
