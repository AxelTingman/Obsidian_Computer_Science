- [[Raspberry Pi]] has an OS, SSH, all the tools -> great device for writing code. 

- [[Arduino]] is great for hardware, but hard to write proper code on. Only low language support, no extensive library support for cloud applications.

In combination they compliment eachother. Usefull for [[Internet of Things (IoT)]].
