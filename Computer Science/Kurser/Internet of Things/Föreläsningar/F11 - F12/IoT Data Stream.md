● A data stream 
	– A sequence of data objects 
	– Continuously generated at a rapid rate 
	– Data object can be described by a multi-dimensional attribute vector ( Continuous, categorical or mixed attribute space). 
● Characteristics of data streams: 
	– Continuous arrival of data objects. 
	– Disordered arrival of data objects. 
	– Potentially unbounded size of a stream. 
	– Normally no persistence of data objects after being processed. 
	– Changing probability distributions of the unknown data generation process.
● Data stream can be generated in: 
	– Various scenarios ( Network of sensor nodes, stock market and network monitoring) 
	– Communication across sensor networks or with a centralized server requires the largest amount of energy as sensing consumes less energy. 
	– Consequently, sensor data processing techniques, including data [[Data fusion|aggregation]], data compression, modeling and online querying, should be performed onsite or in-network to reduce communication cost 
	– Demands on efficient data processing algorithms for sensor systems arise due to the limitations of computational power of sensor node. 
	– Stock market and network monitoring systems, there also exist challenges in processing high-rate data streams.
