## Opportunities
● Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) 
	– A category of IoT applications relay on data collection from large number of mobile sensing devices such as smartphones. 
	– Categorized into three different classes based on the type of phenomenon being measured or mapped: environmental, infrastructure, and social 
● Cyber-Physical Cloud Computing 
	– IoT is a networking infrastructure for Cyber-Physical System (CPS) 
	– Smart networked systems with embedded sensors, processors and actuators 
	– Designed to sense and interact with physical world and support real-time, guaranteed performance in safety-critical applications.

## Challanges
● Cyber Security and Privacy 
	– Human-centered systems 
	– It is important to preserve the security and privacy of an individual 
	– Mobile crowd sensing application potentially collect sensitive sensor data pertaining to individuals. 
● Resource Limitations 
	– Set of mobile devices that are collecting sensor data are highly dynamic in Availability and Capabilities. 
	– Due to this dynamic nature modeling and predicting the energy, bandwidth requirements in community sensing
