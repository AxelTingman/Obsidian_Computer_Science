● Data fusion (or data aggregation) for two reasons: 
	– Users may be interested only in the aggregated results of sensory data (e.g., the average temperature or noise level). 
	– Sensory data collected in close proximity or time periods may be highly correlated, and data fusion can effectively eliminate redundancy and hence reduce network overhead.
