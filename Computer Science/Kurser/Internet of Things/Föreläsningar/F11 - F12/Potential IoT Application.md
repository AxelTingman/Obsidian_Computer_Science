● Smart Cities and homes
	– IoT can connect billions of smart [[Things|things]] and can help capture information in cities 
	– In a modern city, lots of digital data traces are generated there every second via cameras and sensors of all kinds 
	– IoT can facilitate resources management issues for modern cities – static resources (e.g., fire stations and parking spots) and mobile resources (e.g., police cars and fire trucks) in a city can be managed effectively using IoT technologies. 
● Environment Monitoring 
	– IoT technologies can also help to monitor and [[Sustainability|protect environments]] thereby improving human's knowledge about environments. 
	– IoT could improve water management in a city. 
	– A device has been designed and built to monitor residential noise pollution to address and determine what kind of sound is noise.
● Health 
	– Healthcare environment such as a large hospital or aged care could tag all pieces of medical equipment . 
	– As personal health sensors become ubiquitous, they are expected to become interoperable. 
	– Mobile technology and sensors are creating ways to inexpensively and continuously monitor people's health. 
	– Consumers would be able to self-track their pulse and studies show heart rate monitoring could be useful in detecting heart conditions and enabling early diagnosis. 
	– include data on blood sugar levels, and other biometrics collected via mobile devices.
● Energy 
	– Home heating is a major factor in worldwide energy use IoT, home energy management applications could be built upon embedded Web servers 
	– IoT applications would allow drivers to find the most fuel-efficient routes for their vehicles between arbitrary end-points. 
	– Smart Grid is the concept of integrating information technologies to the legacy power grids for [[Sustainability|optimizing its operation]]. IoT concept can be used to provide embedded intelligence to the existing grids in developing countries. The different segments of power grids which require monitoring or control includes electricity generation, transmission, distribution and its consumption.
- Business
	IoT technologies would be able to help to improve efficiency in business and bring other impacts on business: 
	- Commercial point of view 
	- Social and political point of view 
	- Personal point of view 
	- a set of tools and standards for tracking and sharing RFID-tagged products in IoT. 
	- IoT technologies could be used to make it easier to use all this data, to integrate it into various applications, and to build more flexible, scalable, global application for better (even real-time) logistics.
