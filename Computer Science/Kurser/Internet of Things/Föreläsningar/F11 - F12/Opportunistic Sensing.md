● A commonly used method for opportunistic sensing is to make every mobile user sense periodically 
● Many redundant data samples may be produced by a large number of mobile users 
● In order to reduce data redundancy and improve energy efficiency, it is necessary to design a cooperative sensing method to control sensing activities of mobile users such that they produce just enough data samples for the application
