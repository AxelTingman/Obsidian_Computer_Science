Relevant areas such as the Deep Web, Semantic Web and then searching things in the IoT environments. 
● Deep Web (DW) and Semantic Web(SW) – DW: That is not indexed by standard search engines. 
	– DW is estimated to be several orders of magnitude larger than that of the so-called Surface Web (the Web that is accessible and indexable by text search engines). 
	– DW provides a wealth of hidden data in semi-structured form, accessible through Web forms and Web services. 
	– SW grows as a common structured data source. 
	– SW is standard (W3C) with Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). 
	– SW aims to unify the way semantic information is stored and exchanged. 
	– SW makes it possible for machines themselves to not just read, but also “understand” the data from data sources, which enables machine to machine communication 
● Web [[IoT Search Techniques|Search]] (Virtual Twitter User (VTU) :which can actively post tweets on the Web. VTU monitor conditions such as temperature, humidity and radiation levels. It then automatically tweets the resulting data via Twitter 
	– Real-time web search 
		• Twitter handled more than 85 million tweets per day in 2015 , 
		• real-time search service is indeed very challenging in such Large-scale micro-blogging systems 
	– Searching information over RDF data 
		• Semantic Web community uses a very different data model, which is RDF, MIDAS-RDF, a distributed [[Peer to peer|P2P]] RDF/S repository that is built on top of a distributed multi-dimensional index structure 
	– Collaborative web search 
● Search of Things in IoT 
	– Keywords based search of Things 
	– Collaborative search of [[Things|things]]
