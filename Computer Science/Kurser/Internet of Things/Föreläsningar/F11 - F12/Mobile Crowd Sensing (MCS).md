● Human involvement is one of the most important Characteristics of MCS : 
	– Compared to traditional sensor networks, human mobility offers unprecedented opportunities for both sensing coverage and data transmission. 
● Two classes of sensing paradigms in MCS: 
	– [[Crowd sourcing|Participatory Sensing]] (Participants to consciously opt to meet the application requests by deciding When, what and How to Sense) 
	– [[Opportunistic Sensing|Opportunistic Sensing]] (fully unconscious, namely the application may run in the back- ground and opportunistically collect data ) 
● Opportunistic sensing more support Large-scale deployments and application diversity 
● Two classes of transmission paradigms 
	– Infrastructure-based transmission (users reporting and accessing sensory data through the Internet by 4G/5G) 
	– [[Opportunistic Transmission|Opportunistic transmission]] (opportunistic data forwarding among mobile users through intermittent connections WiFi or Bluetooth)

## Human involvment
● One of the important characteristics of MCS is deeper involvement of humans in: 
	– Data-to-decision process, Sensing, Transmission, Analysis of big sensory data and Decision making 
● Double- edged sword 
	– Easier to deploy the network at lower cost –› human mobility can be exploited to improve sensing coverage and data transmission. 
		– Easier to maintain the network -› mobile nodes are always managed and maintained in good condition by their holders. 
		– Extensible and flexible -› users to adapt to the expansion of the system scale. 
		– Availability of sensors, and the data quality always change over time due to the randomness of human mobility and the dynamics of human contexts. 
		– Human involvement naturally brings privacy concerns. 
		– participating in MCS, mobile users consume their own resources.
