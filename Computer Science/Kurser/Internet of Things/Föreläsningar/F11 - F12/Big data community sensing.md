## Opportunities
– Big Data Analytics enables the move from IoT to real-time control, which is desired for many community sensing applications. 
– In the era of IoT, Smart Community Sensing (SCS) feature the deployment of multitude of wireless sensors and agents spanning many application domains including: environmental, healthcare, smart interconnected automobiles and trucks, and smart buildings.

## Challenges
– Data Heterogeneity: How to translate physical, biological, or social variables into a meaningful electrical signal is a challenge. 
	• How to improve quality (accuracy) of data in real time, i.e., sampling and filtering. • how to unify data representation and processing models to accommodate heterogeneous or new types of data. 
	• how to improve intelligent data interpretation and semantic interoperability. • how to implement inter-situation analysis and prediction. 
	• how to implement knowledge creation and reasoning. 
	• how to conduct short-term and long-term [[IoT Data storage models|storage]] 
– Decision making under Uncertainty: 
	• Many sources of uncertainty must be considered in decision-making. 
	• our understanding of many issues facing cities is incomplete. 
	• we often lack the data needed to specify the boundary conditions with sufficient accuracy 
	• We must improve decision making under uncertainty by understanding assessment, representation and propagation of uncertainty, developing robust-optimization methods, and designing optimal sequential decision making.
