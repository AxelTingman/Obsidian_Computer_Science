● Sustainability of a community depends on creating and maintaining its economic and environmental health, promoting social equity, and fostering broad-based citizen participation in planning and implementation 
● Communities that engage citizens and institutions to develop sustainability principles and a collective vision for the future and that apply an integrative approach to environmental, economic, and social goals are generally likely to be more successful. 
● Job creation, energy use, housing, transportation, education and health are considered complementary parts of the whole. Since all issues are interconnected they must be addressed as a system.

## As a system
The process includes: 
● broad and diverse involvement of citizens 
● the creation of a collective vision for the future 
● the development of principles of sustainability 
● an inventory of existing assets and resources and additional assets that would benefit the community 
● clear, measurable goals 
● the development of community indicators to evaluate progress 
● open and transparent communication 
● early, visible results 
● celebration of success
● Sustainability is a process of continuous improvement so communities constantly evolve and make changes to accomplish their goals. 
● ways to make your community healthier, safer, greener, more livable, and more prosperous.
