#### Definition: *overlay*

#### Why do we need overlay?
- To create a service that is not (or cannot be) provided by the network (layer3)
- Example of services:
	- Application layer multicast
	- [[Content-based subscription|Content Delivery Network]]
	- DNS (IP only provides IP addresses and don't know how to route on names)
