A *fog network* is a network architecture that uses one or a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of storage (rather than stored primarily on cloud data centers), communication (rather than routed over backbone networks), and control, configuration, measurement and management (rather than controlled primarily by the network gateways such as those in LTE core).

Fog computing is becoming possible when devices are becoming more powerful in their capacity of sensing, storing, computing, controlling and communicating.

Fog computing is limited by the fact that devices still have low battery capacity, [[IoT Data storage models|storage]], computing and information.

It has become interesting to ask "Can *this* be done at clients/edge?"

In "traditional" solutions, the client use the server, while in fog netwoks the clients are a part of the sytem's computing resources.
